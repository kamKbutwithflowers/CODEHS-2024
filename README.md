soooooo......
if you have any quiestions just ask....
also the "main" thing is kina strange

exa..

function start() {
    if (frontIsBlocked()){
        turnLeft();
        move();
    } else {
        move();
    }
}

instaed of "start" put "main" then do a main command at the end like- "main();"

exa

function main() {
    if (frontIsBlocked()){
        turnLeft();
        move();
    } else {
        move();
    }
}
main();

but it is relitvely easy if anymore code needs to be added just ask and ill put it good luck.....
